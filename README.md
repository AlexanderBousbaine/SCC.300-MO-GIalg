# SCC.300-MO-GIalg

Contains the code for the Meta-Optimisation Algorithm that I am creating for SCC.300.
ConfirmComplete goes into GIalgorithm folder.

##### Calculating the size of the search space
The algorithm contains 18 genes. 16 of these genes have allele domains with 100 values and 2 have domains with 15 values.\
The combined search space of the 16 100-value genes is ~1.50e19.\
The combined search space of the 2 15-value genes is 120.\
Therefore, the total combined search space is ~1.80e21 possible combinations of parameters.
